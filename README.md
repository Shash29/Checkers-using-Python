# Checkers-using-Python
An implementation of the checkers board game using some simple concepts of Python. The GUI of the game has been implemented using the Turtle library. 
Basic rules of Checkers:- https://www.ducksters.com/games/checkers_rules.php

This implementation is for Player vs Player. Player vs Computer coming soon! ;-)

About GUI:- Background is initially blue,but at any point of the game,the Background colour specifies which player has to make his move in the current turn.
The game begins with Red pieces' turn. The game ends when one of the players has no pieces left.
